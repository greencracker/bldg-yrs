        	<p><h1>FAQs and sources</h1></p>

			<p>// DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT -- Some of these FAQ are not answered yet.</p> 

			<p><b>Q: How do you know when a building was built? Are the construction years always right?</b></p>
            <p>A:  ?Tax Assessor? Court? any issues with data? </p>

            <p>Some property parcels have more than one construction year attached to them ...</p>

			<p><b>Q: There are a lot of buildings without a year, like Fort McPherson, state-owned buildings and universities. Why?</b></p>

			<p>A:  ?? Maybe they dont generate property tax or sales records?? </p>

            <p><b>Q: Where's the new Mercedes-Benz stadium?</b></p>

			<p>A: This map and data ends in 2015. We don't have any newer data, so this is more like a look at the past.</p>

            <p>This map does not include the Emory University campus and nearby areas that are to join the city on Jan. 1, 2018.</p>

			<p><b>Q: Where exactly did this data come from?</b></p>

            <p>A: Several places. The city of Atlanta published a citywide building footprint map. That map, minus small buildings like carports and garden sheds, is publicly available from SR <a href="https://maggielee.carto.com/tables/building_footprints_small" target="_blank">via CARTO</a>.</p>

			<p>Atlanta, in turn, got the Fulton County parts of the map from the county. The countywide map <a href="http://gisdata.fultoncountyga.gov/datasets/structures?geometry=-84.409%2C33.753%2C-84.363%2C33.766" target="_blank">is availble here, with extensive footnotes on how they assembled the building outlines</a> via the likes of tax records and even aerial photography.</p>

            <p>Fulton County also attached a construction year to each building footprint, based on data from the parcel on which the building sits.</p>

            <p>For single buildings that sit on a single parcel, like single-family homes, that's pretty straightforward to do with mapping software.</p>

            <p>But it can be difficult to match some buildings to some parcels. For example, if several buildings sit on one parcel, or if one building crosses several parcels. In those cases, the year assigned to a particular building might not be the right one.</p>

            <p>Also, some buildings that are very close to each other — or that are connected by a sky bridge — show up as one bulding on the map. That's because some of the map is constructed from aerial photographs. The photographs were cutting-edge years ago when they were made, but aren't fine enough to show the difference between very close buildings.</p>

            <p>Or, even when there's a simple one-to-one match, the construction year ... ?Tax Assessor?? Superior court?? any known issues data??</p>

            <p> DeKalb construction year data comes from that county tax assessor's office. Using mapping software, SR similarly attached a construction year to each building, based on data from the parcel on which it sits.</p>

            <p>In the very few cases of one building crossing several parcels in DeKalb, SR assigned it no year. In the very few cases of several buildings all on one parcel (like the East Lake Golf Club), each building gets assigned the same year, the year that tax records assign to the whole parcel.</p>

            <p>For a handful of historic buildings, additional construction year data comes from Atlanta's <a href="https://www.atlantaga.gov/government/departments/planning-community-development/office-of-zoning-development/urban-design-commission/property-district-information" target="_blank">landmark and historic building registry</a> and the <a href="https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org" target="_blank">New Georiga Encyclopedia</a>, and those building's web sites or media coverage.</p>
