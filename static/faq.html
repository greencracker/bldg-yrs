        	<p><h1>FAQs and sources</h1></p>

			<p>// DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT -- None of these FAQ are answered yet. The data set ends in 2015. So no Mercedes-Benz Stadium, no newer construction years. The map doesn't include the Emory annexation, which will be official on Jan. 1, 2018. This map does not include building footprints of less than 120 square feet.</p> 

			<p><b>Q: How do you know when a building was built? Are the construction years always right?</b></p>
            <p>A:  </p>

			<p><b>Q: There are a lot of buildings without a year, like Fort McPherson, state-owned buildings and universities. Why?</b></p>

			<p>A:  </p>

            <p><b>Q: [Some other explainer question]?</b></p>

			<p>// Other reasons why data may be missing.</p>

			<p><b>Q: Where did this data come from?</b></p>

            <p>A: Several places. The city of Atlanta published a citywide building footprint map. That map, minus small buildings like carports and building sheds, is publicly available from SR <a href="https://maggielee.carto.com/tables/building_footprints_small" target="_blank">via CARTO</a>.</p>

			<p>Atlanta, in turn, got the Fulton County parts of the map from the county. The countwide map <a href="http://gisdata.fultoncountyga.gov/datasets/structures?geometry=-84.409%2C33.753%2C-84.363%2C33.766" target="_blank">is availble here</a>. Fulton used aerial photography and county Tax Assessor records to draw the footprints.</p>

            <p>Fulton County also took those building footprints and attached a construction year, based on tax data from the parcel on which the building sits.</p>

            <p>For single buildings that sit on a single parcel, like single-family homes, that's pretty straightforward to do with mapping software.</p>

            <p>But it does make for some loose ends when, for example, big buildings Downtown cross several parcels. Or when buildings are so close together that they look like one building from an aerial photograph. ... In those cases ...? </p>

            <p> DeKalb construction year data comes from the county tax commissioner's office. Using mapping software, SR similarly attached a construction year to each building, based on tax data from the parcel on which it sits.</p>

            <p>In the very few cases of one building crossing several parcels in DeKalb, SR assigned it no year. In the very few cases of several buildings all on one parcel (like the East Lake Golf Club), each building gets assigned the same year, the year that tax records assign to the whole parcel.</p>

            <p>For a handful of historic buildings, additional construction year data comes from Atlanta's <a href="https://www.atlantaga.gov/government/departments/planning-community-development/office-of-zoning-development/urban-design-commission/property-district-information" target="_blank">landmark and historic building registry</a> and the <a href="https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org" target="_blank">New Georiga Encyclopedia</a>.</p>
