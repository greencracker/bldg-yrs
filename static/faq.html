        	<p><h1>FAQs and sources</h1></p>

			<p>// DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT -- None of these FAQ are answered yet. The data set ends in 2015. So no Mercedes-Benz Stadium, no newer construction years. The map doesn't include the Emory annexation, which will be official on Jan. 1, 2018. This map does not include building footprints of less than 120 square feet.</p> 

			<p><b>Q: How do you know when a building was built? Are the construction years always right?</b></p>
            <p>A:  </p>

			<p><b>Q: There are a lot of buildings without a year, like Fort McPherson, state-owned buildings and universities. Why?</b></p>

			<p>A:  </p>

            <p><b>Q: [Some other explainer question]?</b></p>

			<p>// Other reasons why data may be missing.</p>

			<p><b>Q: Where did this data come from?</b></p>

			<p>A: The city of Atlanta Department of City Planningâ€™s GIS office published the map of building footprint outlines and SR downloaded it in July, 2017. </p>

            <p>It was ??? created by ??? TBD.</p> 
            <p>Construction year data for most Fulton buildings comes from the same source... ???and ultimatley from tax data?</p>
            
            <p> DeKalb construction year data comes from the county tax commissioner's office. Using mapping software, DeKalb buildnings were assigned a construction year based on tax information tied to the parcel on which they sit. In the very few cases of several buildings all on one parcel (like the East Lake Golf Club), each building gets assigned the same year, the year of the oldest building on the parcel.</p>

            <p>Additional construction year data comes from Atlanta's <a href="https://www.atlantaga.gov/government/departments/planning-community-development/office-of-zoning-development/urban-design-commission/property-district-information" target="_blank">landmark and historic building registry</a> and the <a href="https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org" target="_blank">New Georiga Encyclopedia</a>.</p>

            <p>The building footprint map, minus small buildings, is publicly available from SR <a href="https://maggielee.carto.com/tables/building_footprints_small" target="_blank">via CARTO<a>.</p>
